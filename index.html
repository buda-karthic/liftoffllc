            <div class="add-flex gap-3">
              <p class="body-text">
                Christy Desai, Okay Humans Co-Founder, CEO and LMFT, joined
                forces with the founders of <a href="#">Drybar</a> and
                <a href="#">Squeeze</a> to bring her new talk therapy concept to
                life. Boasting a combined 100+ years of launching and operating
                experience-driven, customer obsessed brands, the multifaceted
                team has their sights set on changing the way people experience
                retail across categories – and more importantly – leaving their
                mark on people’s lives, and the world, for good.

                Christy’s own experience with therapy turned into a personal
                mission to help other people feel better, stronger, and more
                alive. She believes there’s no reason why talking to a trained
                professional shouldn’t be as acceptable as going to the dentist,
                the hair salon, or seeking out a personal trainer. Okay Humans
                was designed to normalize seeking support, to rethink the
                outdated therapy model, and to open up the conversation about
                getting to okay.
